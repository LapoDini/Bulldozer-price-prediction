# Bulldozer-price-prediction
This project aims to train a model to predict the price of heavy machines. We perform a brief EDA to find some insight, after that we manipulate the dataset (filling in missing values, and converting categories into numbers) and then we trained a model to predict the final price. 

## Data
The dataset was provided from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

This dataset has more than 400000 samples and more than 50 features, and a data dictionary is provided here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTbZNhQwWedzw6y1VFqhsvfJo3rtyzen62a6G0rnwufZo9FAtbiO3qO4xbAGmANWQT9jDUg6N_E_knw/pubhtml
